      <h2>What is this?</h2>
      <p>
        This is an application that will let you generate a script that can be run inside of the Warbirds game that will print out information about objects destroyed and remaining.
      </p>
      <h2>Why do I want this?</h2>
      <p>
        If you have to ask you probably don't need it. It is useful in some gameplay to be able to have an idea of what assets remain in a field.
      </p>
      <h2>How do I use this</h2>
      <p>
        <ol>
          <li>Each field has several objects.</li>
          <li>Turning on ground labels in Warbirds you can read these labels.</li>
          <li>Another way to get a list of objects in a field is to use the destroyall dotcommand. e.g. if you type in:
          </li>
        </ol>
      </p>
      <pre>
        .destroyall 1
      </pre>
      <p>
        This will destroy all objects in field 1 and print out a list of objects destroyed. The objects are labeled something like: F012HG001 or F123G0001. The Fnnn stands for the field number paded with 0s so F1 should be written F001. The next part XXnnn is a two letter asset type code and the asset number. If field 5 has two hangers they would be named F005HG001 and F005HG002. To specify 2 hangers select "HG" from the "Type" drop down. Select 2 for "How Many" and leave "Start at" alone for now. click on the "+" or add button. Set the Field number to 5.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you make a mistake you can remove an entry by pressing the "-" button next to it and you can always correct quantaties in the above drop down boxes and hit + again to see the change affected.
      </p>
      <p>
        The script is generated as you make changes in the area at the bottom of the page.
      </p>
